                    <!-- paragraph about Abstract -->
                    <p>Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It
                        is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences. Technology has certainly changed the
                        way we live. It has impacted different facets of life and redefined living. Undoubtedly,
                        technology plays an important role in every sphere of life. Several manual tasks can be
                        automated, thanks to technology. Also, many complex and critical processes can be carried out
                        with ease and greater efficiency with the help of modern technology. Thanks to the application
                        of technology, living has changed and it has changed for better. Technology has revolutionized
                        the field of education. The importance of technology in schools cannot be ignored. In fact, with
                        the onset of computers in education, it has become easier for teachers to impart knowledge and
                        for students to acquire it. The use of technology has made the process of teaching and learning
                        all the more enjoyable.</p>

                    <!-- paragraph about positive impacts -->
                    <p>In recent years, technology has become more integrated into the classroom to improve children's
                        learning experiences. Smartboards, document cameras, Apple TVs, and even 3D printers are now
                        being used in educational settings to boost collaboration and engage students in the learning
                        process. As a result of enhanced classroom interaction, teachers and students have more
                        opportunities for creativity and project-based learning, making academic teaching more relevant.
                        Have you ever heard the term "survival mode"? It's a feature seen in many children's video games
                        that challenges the player to stay alive for as long as possible in order to outlive their
                        opponents. For example, in the popular video game Minecraft, players are dumped into new and
                        unfamiliar environments and must immediately create shelter and obtain commodities such as food
                        in order to endure and outlast their adversaries Furthermore, because a day in Minecraft only
                        lasts 10 minutes, players must make quick decisions. In order to achieve a certain goal, these
                        technologies require children to work autonomously. Throughout the process, individuals are met
                        with a range of obstacles and issues that they must learn to handle and overcome. Many of
                        today's emerging technologies are widely acknowledged to hold the key to our future. In the
                        future years, technical skills will become increasingly important in the workplace, as will the
                        growing impact they will have on daily life. One of the most important benefits of exposing
                        children to technology is that they will be well-prepared to enter a pool of available,
                        well-paying tech jobs..</p>

                    <!-- paragraph about negative impacts  -->
                    <p>As children become more dependant on mobile devices, they are more likely to be digitally
                        connected with family and friends than to spend physical time with them; they are more likely to
                        text, communicate on social media, or interact through online games than to meet them in person.
                        "Social communication skills are also under threat as a result of computer usage," Lisa Rai
                        Mabry-Price, associate director of school services for the American Speech-Language-Hearing
                        Association (ASHA), told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Knowing how to take turns during a
                        conversation, using facial expressions, adjusting your speech based on the listener (for
                        example, how to speak to a baby vs an adult), and making appropriate eye contact are all skills
                        that may be learnt and honed via everyday interaction Mobile device overuse can be harmful to
                        children's health since the more time they spend on them, the less time they spend on physical
                        exercise. Furthermore, when children prefer to play on their electronic devices rather than
                        participate in physical activity, they are more prone to indulge in mindless eating and other
                        unhealthy behaviors. Children are spending less time outside playing, running, and burning
                        calories as they spend more time in front of devices, usually on the couch. Over time, these
                        activities can result in significant weight gain and other health problems.</p>

                    <!-- paragraph about Conclusion -->
                    <p>Technology has a positive impact on education and at the same time may also pose negative
                        effects. Teachers and students should take advantage of this in the good light and eliminate the
                        drawbacks which are pulling back many of students as well as schools from achieving excellence.
                        It is thus time for every country to introduce a more technologically equipped education sector
                        in the future.</p>
